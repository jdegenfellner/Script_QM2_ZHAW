# Reliability and Validity

For this chapter we refer to the book 
[Measurement in Medicine](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/measurement-in-medicine/8BD913A1DA0ECCBA951AC4C1F719BCC5).

I invite you to read the introductory chapters 1 and 2 about concepts,
theories and models, and types of measurement.

In general, when conducting a measurement of any sort 
(laboratory measurements, scores from questionnaires, etc.), 
we want to be reasonably sure

- that we actually **measure what we intend to measure**; 
  ([validity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_(statistics)); 
  chapter 6 in the book);
- that the measurement does **not change too much** if the 
  underlying **conditions are the same**
  ([reliability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_(statistics)); 
  chapter 5 in the book); and
- that we are able to detect a **change** if the underlying conditions change 
  ([responsiveness](https://tinyurl.com/3vdcxy49); chapter 7 in the book); and
- that we understand the meaning of a change in the measurement
  (interpretability; chapter 8 in the book).

In this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuT2n1w0Ixc&ab_channel=Physiotutors), 
Kai jump starts you on reliability and validity.


## Reliability
You can watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HSoWaRpcys&ab_channel=Physiotutors) 
to get started.

Imagine, you measure a patient (pick your favorite measurement), for example,
the range of motion (ROM) of the shoulder. 

- If you are interested in how
  similar your measurements are in comparison to your colleagues, you are 
  trying to determine the so-called **inter-rater reliability**.
- If you are interested in how similar your measurements are when you measure
  the same patient twice, you are trying to determine the so-called 
  **intra-rater reliability**.

Assuming there is a true (but unknown) underlying value (of ROM), 
it is clear that measurements will not be *exactly* the same. 
Possible influences (potentially) causing different results are:

- the measurement instrument itself (e.g., the goniometer),
- the patient (e.g., mood/motivation),
- the examiner (e.g., mood, influence on patient),
- the environment (e.g., the room temperature).

Note that the **true score** is defined in our context as the average of all measurements
if we would measure repeat it an infinite number of times.

## TODOS

- Bayes ICC
- mention missing values, missingness mechanisms -> Methodenvertiefung
- Logistic Regression, Poisson, -> Methodenvertiefung
- Exercise: Show by simulation what Gelman talks about with significant p values. So I scan the data
  for significant p values and then simulate data with the same effect size and see how often
  I get significant p values. Especially the next effect would be probably smaller,
  especially, if one did p-hacking! Calculate a priori probability for replication (def?).
- Chapter: Sample size calculations for multivariate regression, Proportions, ICCs, t.test
- Chapter about Reliability, Validity and ICCs (incl. simulation of what an ICC of 0.9 or so means), but maybe reduced
- Angenommen man hat ein masking eines Effekts und der Model fit ist aber gut (keine Voraussetzung verletzt), 
  ist diese Situation mÃ¶glich?
- What about papers? -> eLearning
- AIC, BIC, cross-validation, Model selection (best subset, leaps....), Variable selection
- More on bias variance tradeoff, show for polynomial regression?
- include eLearning tasks in script.
