In the first part, we learned about the basics of probability theory, descriptive statistics, Bayesian statistics, and hypothesis testing. In this script, we will dive into the basics of statistical modeling - a world of aesthetic wonder and surprises. This script is a work in progress and will be updated as we go along. Please feel free to send me suggestions for improvements or corrections. As the first one, this should be a collaborative effort and will (hopefully) never be finished as our insight grows over time. For the working setup with R, please see this and the following sections in the first script. 1.1 Books we will heavily borrow from are: Statistical Rethinking, YouTube-Playlist: Statistical Rethinking 2023 (Free) Understanding Regression Analysis: A Conditional Distribution Approach Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models (Free) Doing Bayesian Data Analysis "],["intro.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction 2.1 What is statistical modeling and what do we need this for?", " Chapter 2 Introduction 2.1 What is statistical modeling and what do we need this for? In rather broad sense a statistical model is a mathematical representation of a real-world process or relationship between variables. In most cases, one simplifies the complex reality in order to make it better understandable, mathematically treatable and to make predictions. Underlying our models, there are theories which should be falsifiable and testable. For instance, I would be really surprised if I pull up my …….. It is a simplification of reality that allows us to make predictions and draw conclusions from data.
