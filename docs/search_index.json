In the first part, we learned about the basics of probability theory, descriptive statistics, Bayesian statistics, and hypothesis testing. In this script, we will dive into the basics of statistical modeling - a world of aesthetic wonder and surprises. This script is a first draft as you are the first group to be working with it. Please feel free to send me suggestions for improvements or corrections. This should be a collaborative effort and will (hopefully) never be finished as our insight grows over time. The script can also be seen as a pointer to great sources which are fit to deepen your understanding of the topics. Knowledge is decentralized, and there are many great ressources out there. For the working setup with R, please see this and the following sections in the first script. 1.1 Books we will heavily borrow from are: (Free) Statistical Rethinking, YouTube-Playlist: Statistical Rethinking 2023 (Free) Understanding Regression Analysis: A Conditional Distribution Approach Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models (Free) Doing Bayesian Data Analysis "],["intro.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction 2.1 What is statistical modeling and what do we need this for? 2.2 Exercises", " Chapter 2 Introduction 2.1 What is statistical modeling and what do we need this for? Typically, one simplifies the complex reality (and loses information) in order to make it better understandable, mathematically treatable and to make predictions. Underlying our models, there are theories which should be falsifiable and testable. For instance, I would be really surprised if I pull up my multimeter and measure the voltage (V) and electric current (I) at a resistence (R) in a circuit and find that Ohm’s law \\(V = IR\\) is not true. This law can be tested over and over again and if one would find a single valid counterexample, the law would be falsified. It is also true that the law is probably not 100% accularate, but an extremely good approximation of reality. Real-world measurements carry measurement errors and when plotting the data, one would see that the data points might not lie exactly on a straight line. This is not a problem. A statistical model is a mathematical framework that represents the relationships between variables, helping us understand, infer, and predict patterns in data. It acts as a bridge between observed data and the real-world processes that generated them. In health research, where variability and uncertainty are inherent, statistical models are valuable tools for making sense of complex phenomena. You can watch this as short intro. Depending on the task at hand, we would use different models. In any case, logical reasoning and critical thinking comes first, then comes the model. It makes no sense to estimate statistical models just for the sake of it. All models are wrong, but some are useful. Or to quote George Box: “Since all models are wrong the scientist cannot obtain a ‘correct’ one by excessive elaboration. On the contrary following William of Occam he should seek an economical description of natural phenomena. Just as the ability to devise simple but evocative models is the signature of the great scientist so overelaboration and overparameterization is often the mark of mediocrity.” In my opinion, statistical modeling is an art form: difficult and beautiful. One goal of this course is to improve interpretation and limitations of statistical models. They are not magical turning data into truth. Firstly, the rule gargabe in, garbage out (GABA) applies. Secondly, statistical models are based on data and their variability and have inherent limitations one cannot overcome even with the most sophisticated models. This is expressed for instance in the so-called bias-variance trade-off. You can’t have it all. 2.1.1 Explanatory vs. Predictive Models I can recommend reading this article by Shmueli et al. (2010) on this topic. Statistical models serve different purposes depending on the research question. Two primary goals are explanation and prediction, and each requires a different approach: Explanatory Models focus on understanding causal relationships. These models aim to uncover mechanisms and answer “why” questions. For example: Does smoking increase the risk of lung cancer? Yes. (If you want to see what a large effect-size looks like, check out this study.) How large is the “effect” of smoking on lung cancer? Large. Does pain education and graded sensorimotor relearning improve disability (a question we ask in our Resolve Swiss project)? Explanatory models are theory-driven, designed to test hypotheses. Here, one wants to understand the underlying mechanisms and the relationships between variables and hence often uses (parsimonious) models that are more interpretable, like linear regression. Predictive Models prioritize forecasting future outcomes based on patterns in the data. These models aim to answer “what will happen?” For instance: Gait analysis using Machine Learning (ML)? Skin cancer detection using neural networks? Predictive models are data-driven, often using complex algorithms to achieve high accuracy. Their success is measured using metrics like Root Means Square Error (RMSE), Area Unter the Curve (AUC), or prediction error on new, unseen data. Any amount of model complexity is allowed. One could for instance estimate a neural network (“just” another statistical model) with many hidden layers and neurons in order to improve prediction quality. Interpretability of the model weights is not a priority here. While explanatory and predictive goals often complement each other, their differences highlight the importance of clearly defining the purpose of your analysis. In applied health research, explanatory models help identify causal mechanisms, while predictive models can guide real-world decisions by providing actionable forecasts. Together, they enhance both our understanding of phenomena and our ability to make informed decisions in complex environments. 2.1.2 Individual vs. Population Prediction Another important distinction is between individual vs. population prediction. In the smoking example above, we can be very sure about the mean effects that smoking has on lung cancer. On an individual level, it is harder to predict the outcome. Nevertheless, individual predictions will be (notably) better than random guessing. We will discuss this in greater detail. 2.1.3 Practical Use of Statistical Models In my optinion, we should never be afraid to test our statistical models (as honestly as possible) against reality. We could for instance ask ourselves: “How much better does this model classify than the arithmetic mean? (i.e., the linear model with just an intercept)” “How much better does this model classify than random guessing?” Is it worth the effort to collect data and estimate this model by using hundreds of hours of our time? In some cases, these questions can be answered straightforwardly. In advertising (Google, Facebook, …), a couple of percentage points in prediction quality might make a difference of millions of dollars in revenue offsetting the statistitians salary. Improved forecasts of a few percentage points in the stock market or just being slightly better than the average, will make you faboulously rich. Improved cancer forecasting might save lives, money and pain and is not only measured in money. 2.1.4 Start at the beginning What do we actually want to do in general? Very broadly speaking we want to: describe the association of variables to each other that carry variability. Hence, the relationship is not deterministic like \\[y = 2x + 3\\] but rather we need to “loosen up” the relationship to account for variability (in \\(x\\) and \\(y\\)). So, the values \\(2\\) and \\(3\\) are not fixed but aflicted with uncertainty. Depending on your philosophical view, you might say you want to find the “true” but unknown relationship between variables. This is what we do in simulation studies all the time: We know the true relationship, simulate data by adding variability and then try to estimate the true relationship we assumed in the first place. For some practical applications, we can get a really nice and complete answer to our question (for instance sample size for proportions). So we are looking for a function \\(f\\) such that \\[ Y = f(X) \\] where \\(Y\\) is the “outcome”, “dependent variable” or “response”. \\(X\\) are the “predictors”. \\(X\\) can be a single Variable \\(x\\) or many variables \\(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_p\\). It is important to be aware of the notation here: “Predict” does not necessarily mean that we can predict the value in the future. It merely means we estimate the value (or mean) of \\(Y\\) given \\(X\\). This can be done at the same time points, known as cross-sectional analysis (“What is the maximum jumping height of a person given their age at a certain point in time, whereas both variables are measured at the same time?”); or at different time points, known as longitudinal analysis (“What is the maximum jumping height of a person 10 years later (\\(t_2\\)) given their baseline health status at time \\(t_1\\)?”). The simplest statistical model would be the mean model where \\(Y\\) is “predicted” by a constant: \\(Y = c\\) which (at least in the classical linear regression) turns out to be \\(c = \\bar{x}\\). This simple model is often surprisingly good, or, to put it in other words, models with more complexity are often not that much better with regards to multiple metrics. Let’s use the example in Statistical rethinking using data from the !Kun San starting on page 79. library(rethinking) data(&quot;Howell1&quot;) d &lt;- Howell1 str(d) ## &#39;data.frame&#39;: 544 obs. of 4 variables: ## $ height: num 152 140 137 157 145 ... ## $ weight: num 47.8 36.5 31.9 53 41.3 ... ## $ age : num 63 63 65 41 51 35 32 27 19 54 ... ## $ male : int 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 ... d2 &lt;- d[d$age &gt;= 18,] # only adults We want to model the adult height of the !Kun San people. library(tidyverse) d2 %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = height)) + geom_histogram() Since we already have domain knowledge in this area, we can say that heights are usually normally distributed, or at least a mixture of normal distrubutions (female/male). We assume the following model: \\[h_i \\sim \\text{Normal}(\\mu, \\sigma)\\] As in QM1, we want to start with a Bayesian model and hence, we need some priors. Since we are in Switzerland and just for fun, we use the Swiss body heights as prior for the mean. According to the linke (Bundesamt für Statistik), the mean height of \\(n=7,182,252\\) people in the Swiss sample is \\(\\bar{h_i}=171.1\\) \\[ h_i \\sim \\text{Normal}(\\mu, \\sigma) \\] \\[ \\mu \\sim \\text{Normal}(171.1, 20) \\] \\[ \\sigma \\sim \\text{Uniform}(0, 50) \\] Of course we would not need the prior here due to the large sample size, but for enough for demonstration. We are not completely uninformed about body heights and express our knowledge with the prior for \\(\\mu\\).$ The \\(20\\) in the prior for the mean expresses our range of possible true mean values and aknowledge that there are a variety of different subpopulations with different means. Using the Swiss data in the link one could estimate that the standard deviation of the heights from \\(21,873\\) Swiss people is around is \\(25.6553\\) cm (Exercise 1). curve(dnorm(x, 178, 20), from = 100, to = 250) The prior for \\(\\sigma\\) is uniform between \\(0\\) and \\(50\\) cm. This is a very wide prior and just constrains the values to be positive and below \\(50\\) cm. This could be stronger of course. curve(dunif(x, 0, 50), from = -10, to = 60) 2.2 Exercises 2.2.1 [E] Exercise 1 Use the Swiss body heights data to determine - the 95% “Vertrauensintervall” for \\(\\mu\\) and - calculate the standard deviation of the heights from \\(21,873\\) Swiss people.
