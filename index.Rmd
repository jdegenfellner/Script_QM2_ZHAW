# Introduction {#intro0}

This script is a continuation of 
[the first one](https://jdegenfellner.github.io/Script_QM1_ZHAW/) for Quantitative Methods 1 
at ZHAW. 

In the first part, we learned about the basics of probability theory,
descriptive statistics, Bayesian statistics, and hypothesis testing.

In this script, we will dive into the basics of statistical modeling - 
a world of aesthetic wonder and surprises.

This script is a first draft as you are the first group to be working with it.

Please feel free to send me suggestions for improvements or corrections.

This **should be a collaborative effort** and will (hopefully) 
never be finished as our insight grows over time.

The script can also be seen as a pointer to great sources which are
fit to deepen your understanding of the topics. Knowledge is decentralized,
and there are many great ressources out there.

For the working setup with R, please 
see [this](https://jdegenfellner.github.io/Script_QM1_ZHAW/index.html#section) 
and the following sections in the first script.

The complete code for this script can be found 
[here](https://github.com/jdegenfellner/Script_QM2_ZHAW).
