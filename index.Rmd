# Introduction {#intro0}

This script is a continuation of 
[the first one](https://jdegenfellner.github.io/Script_QM1_ZHAW/) for Quantitative Methods 1 
at ZHAW. 

In the first part, we learned about the basics of probability theory,
descriptive statistics, Bayesian statistics, and hypothesis testing.

In this script, we will dive into the basics of statistical modeling - 
a world of aesthetic wonder and surprises.

This script is a work in progress and will be updated as we go along.

Please feel free to send me suggestions for improvements or corrections.

As the first one, this **should be a collaborative effort** and will (hopefully) 
never be finished as our insight grows over time.

For the working setup with R, please 
see [this](https://jdegenfellner.github.io/Script_QM1_ZHAW/index.html#section) 
and the following sections in the first script.
